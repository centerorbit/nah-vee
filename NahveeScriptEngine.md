# Introduction #

The Nah-vee Script Engine is currently a branch of the Nah-vee base project. The goal of this branch is to create a scripted interface mechanism as so Nah-vee can be customized to use different sprite-sheets, different interactions, and different events.


# Details #

The initial build will be with lua.
Future ones will possibly be in different scripting languages (python, javascript, etc..)
