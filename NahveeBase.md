# Introduction #

The main goal of the Nah-vee program is for entertainment and to bring back the retro screen-mate that was popular oh so many years ago. To build on this old idea with modern computers and developer tools will hopefully pave the way to the next generation of smarter more engaging screen-mates. Taking things to the next level.
